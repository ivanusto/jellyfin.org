# Installation on QNAP

:::caution Pre-built NAS Devices

Many pre-built NAS devices are underpowered. We generally do not recommend running Jellyfin on those devices.
See [Hardware Selection](/docs/general/administration/hardware-selection) for more information.

:::

For [QNAP](https://www.qnap.com/), Jellyfin can be installed either automatically via a community-maintained QPKG package or manually using Container Station (Docker / Docker Compose).

## Method 1: Community-Maintained QPKG (Recommended)

A community-maintained QPKG package ([Jellyfin-QPKG](https://github.com/ivanusto/Jellyfin-QPKG)) is available to simplify installation. It automatically configures Container Station to run the official Docker container, mounts your shared folders under `/mnt`, and auto-detects GPU resources for hardware transcoding.

### Installation Steps

1. **Enable Installation of Unsigned Packages**:
   - Open QNAP **App Center**.
   - Go to **Settings** > **General**.
   - Check **Allow installation of applications without valid signatures**.

2. **Download and Install**:
   - Download the latest `.qpkg` file from the [Jellyfin-QPKG Releases](https://github.com/ivanusto/Jellyfin-QPKG/releases).
   - In App Center, click the **Install Manually** icon in the top right.
   - Select the downloaded file and complete the wizard.

3. **Initial Configuration**:
   - All QNAP shared folders are automatically mounted to `/mnt` inside the container.
   - Access the Jellyfin web interface at `http://<QNAP-IP>:8096` to run the startup wizard.

## Method 2: Manual Installation via Container Station

If you prefer to install Jellyfin manually, you can use QNAP's built-in **Container Station** with Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure **Container Station** is installed and running from the App Center.
- Create folders for configuration and cache, e.g., `/share/Container/jellyfin/config` and `/share/Container/jellyfin/cache`.

### Configuration

Create an application (Compose project) in Container Station with the following `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.5'
services:
  jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin/jellyfin:latest
    container_name: jellyfin
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - /share/Container/jellyfin/config:/config
      - /share/Container/jellyfin/cache:/cache
      - /share/Multimedia:/media:ro # Mount media shares as read-only
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## GPU Hardware Transcoding

To enable hardware transcoding (QSV, VA-API, or NVENC/NVDEC) on QNAP NAS devices:

### Intel QuickSync (QSV) / Intel VA-API
If your QNAP NAS has an Intel CPU with integrated graphics, map the iGPU device to the container:

1. **Device Mapping**: Add the device mapping in your Docker Compose or run command:
   ```yaml
   devices:
     - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
   ```
2. **Permissions**: On some QNAP QTS/QuTS Hero versions, `/dev/dri` permissions are restricted to the `admin` user/group. You may need to run `chmod -R 777 /dev/dri` via SSH to allow the container access.
3. **Jellyfin Settings**: In Jellyfin web UI, navigate to **Dashboard** > **Playback** > **Transcoding**, set **Hardware acceleration** to **Intel QuickSync (QSV)** or **Intel VA-API**.

### NVIDIA NVENC / NVDEC
If your QNAP NAS has a compatible NVIDIA graphics card installed:

1. Install the **NVIDIA GPU Driver** from the QNAP App Center.
2. Go to **Control Panel** > **System** > **Hardware** > **Graphics Card** and assign the GPU resource to **Container Station**.
3. For Compose, map the NVIDIA device nodes and driver libraries:
   ```yaml
   devices:
     - /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0
     - /dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl
     - /dev/nvidia-modes:/dev/nvidia-modes
   ```
4. In Jellyfin web UI, set **Hardware acceleration** to **Nvidia NVENC**.
